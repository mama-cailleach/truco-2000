1. Start Simple, Build Up
Screen Clearing & Sectioned Output:
This is the easiest way to immediately improve the CLI experience, keeps the retro/ASCII vibe, and doesn’t require new dependencies or a big refactor.
It’s also easy to undo or adapt later.

Focus on Game Logic First:
Prioritizing correct rules, AI, and features before UI polish is smart. A solid core makes future UI changes much easier.

2. Future-Proofing
Rich/Windows-Curses Later:
Both rich and curses can be added incrementally.

rich is great for color, tables, and layout, and works well with existing print-based code.
curses is more advanced, for full-screen terminal apps, but requires more refactoring.
Both can be layered on top of a well-structured codebase, especially if you keep your game logic separate from your UI code.
Executable & Portability:
You can package your CLI game as a .exe with tools like PyInstaller or cx_Freeze.
Keeping dependencies minimal at first makes this easier.

Web/Mobile Later:
If you keep your game logic decoupled from the CLI, you can later reuse it for a web backend (Flask/FastAPI) or even a mobile app (with Kivy, BeeWare, or as a web app).

3. Thematic Consistency
CLI/ASCII Art Vibe:
Your “Truco 2000” millennium bug/retro theme fits perfectly with a CLI and ASCII art.
You can keep this aesthetic even as you add color or layout improvements with rich.

4. Feature Roadmap
Tutorial, Menu, Story Mode, AI:
All these features are easier to add and test in a CLI before worrying about a more complex UI.

Summary & Recommendations
Yes, your plan is good and realistic.
Start with screen clearing and sectioned output.
Focus on game logic and features.
When ready, experiment with rich for color/layout, or curses for a more interactive CLI.
Keep your game logic and UI separate for easy future migration to web/mobile.
Your retro/CLI/ASCII art theme is a great fit for your vision.
If you keep your code modular, you’ll be able to evolve the UI as your skills and ambitions grow—without losing your progress.
