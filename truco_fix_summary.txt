Truco Logic Fix Summary
======================

Fix Applied:
- Changed hardcoded `last_accepted_value = 1` to `last_accepted_value = self.current_hand_value`
- This ensures that when tracking truco escalations, we use the actual current hand value

Why this matters:
1. Each new hand starts with current_hand_value = 1 (correctly reset in jogar_mao())
2. If a truco sequence happens mid-hand, we need to track from the current accepted value
3. When someone runs from a truco, we award points based on the previously accepted value

Example scenarios:

Scenario 1: New Hand (Normal behavior)
- Hand starts: current_hand_value = 1
- Player calls Truco (3): last_accepted_value = 1 (✓ correct)
- If opponent runs: award 1 point (✓ correct)

Scenario 2: Mid-hand Truco (Previously buggy)
- Hand already has: current_hand_value = 3 (from previous truco)
- Player calls Retruco (6): last_accepted_value = 3 (✓ now correct, was 1 before)
- If opponent runs: award 3 points (✓ now correct, was 1 before)

Scenario 3: High-value Truco
- Hand already has: current_hand_value = 9
- Player calls Vale 12: last_accepted_value = 9 (✓ now correct)
- If opponent runs: award 9 points (✓ now correct)

The fix ensures proper point calculation in all truco scenarios while maintaining
the correct hand value reset (1) at the start of each new hand.
